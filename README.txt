ABOUT octo
-----------

octo is a base theme that provides many classes in its markup. For cleaner
markup (fewer classes), the default Stable base theme can be used instead.

To use octo as your base theme, set the 'base theme' in your theme's .info.yml
file to "octo":
  base theme: octo

See https://www.drupal.org/theme-guide/8/octo for more information on using
the octo theme.
